# github-flow-demo
## Description
This repository is for me to practice GitHub flow. Every student needs to do the following things to add a helper message for a Git command:

Git Command helper message: 
git branch -m main: Renames the branch to main, instead of the default master. Other names can be used instead of main. -m determines 
that the branch is to be renamed or moved.

1. create an issue: students need to come up their own Git command and figure out an example to show how to use that Git command
2. create a branch: students need to create a branch to add their commits
3. add commits: students need to write in this README.md file to add their own Git command's helper message
4. create a pull request
5. address the review comments
6. merge the pull request
7. delete the branch

The details can be seen at: https://canvas.emich.edu/courses/73774/assignments/1315570?module_item_id=3371349

Git command explanation:  

`git commit readme.md` Will commit the README file to the repository!

'git branch <branch name>' (this will create a new branch with the desiganted name)


'git status' (this will show the status of files in a repo)
