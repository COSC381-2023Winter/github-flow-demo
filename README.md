# github-flow-demo
## Description
This repository is for students to practice GitHub flow. Every student needs to do the following things to add a helper message for a Git command:

1. create an issue: students need to come up their own Git command and figure out an example to show how to use that Git command
2. create a branch: students need to create a branch to add their commits
3. add commits: students need to write in this README.md file to add their own Git command's helper message
4. create a pull request
5. address the review comments
6. merge the pull request
7. delete the branch
