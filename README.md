issue #67

## Description
This repository is for me to practice GitHub flow. Every student needs to do the following things to add a helper messege for a Git command:

Git Command helper message:

git branch -m main: Renames the branch to main, instead of the default master. Other names can be used instead of main. -m determines
that the branch is to be renamed or moved.




1. create an issue: students need to come up their own Git command and figure out an example to sh$
2. create a branch: students need to create a branch to add their commits
3. add commits: students need to write in this README.md file to add their own Git command's helpe$
4. create a pull request
5. address the review comments
6. merge the pull request
7. delete the branch

issue #61


git helper command message:

git branch -d [branch name] this command deletes whatever branch of your chosing

Git command explanation:

`git commit readme.md` Will commit the README file to the repository!

`git branch <branch name>` Will create a new Branch with given name

`git rebase <branch name>` Allows to modify the commit history of a branch.

'git branch <branch name>' (this will create a new branch with the desiganted name)

'git log' (displays a history of commits made to the repository)
    Options include: --graph (displays history in a chronological graph)
                     --all (displays history of everything)
                     --oneline (keeps commit description information to oneline) :) <-- emoji

`git switch <branch name>` This command allows you to switch between branches :smile:
                   
'git diff' (This allows you to see the difference between any two branches or commits.)
    Options include: --output=<file> (outputs to a specific file)
                     --patch (creates a patch)
                     --raw (outputs the diff in RAW)
    Note that --patch is the default option.
